		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hey there, I am Tristan Munnik. I am currently a student for Boston City Campus in South Africa studying a diploma in Systems Development. I have fallen in love with Full Stack Development for codecademy.</p>
		<p>I am enjoying the path of web development and creating small projects that will improve my skills and will lead to landing my first job.</p>
		<p>My goal is to become a successful web developer. I want to continuously improve my skills and gain more experience in the field.</p>
		<p>I have always been interested in technology since I was a kid. Which started from playing games to wanting to learn every bit of a computer and now learning to code.</p>
